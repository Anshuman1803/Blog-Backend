        "blogTitle": "TOP 5 PUSH UP VARIATIONS THE BEST PRESSING VARIATIONS FOR STRENGTH, SIZE, AND POWER!",

        "blogDesc": "Oftentimes the Barbell Bench Press is hailed as the king of pressing exercises and while I may be tempted to agree; I still to this day believe the Push Up and it’s many variations to remain the undisputed champion for the press category. The push up pattern creates an ideal environment for improving your pressing strength and skill due to the closed chain biomechanics of the shoulders. The massive benefits to programming push ups should NEVER be overlooked in any type of health, fitness or performance program. With hands stable on a solid surface, kinematics of the shoulder complex change, freeing the shoulder blades to dynamically stabilize and move on the thoracic cage while reducing stress on the front side of the true shoulder joint.plates, chains, whatever you got over the lower back instead. This will work the core harder AND integrate the lower body. Train for strength in the 6-12 rep ranges and muscular hypertrophy in the 12-20 rep range while adding appropriate load.",

        "blogDesc": "Single leg work is one of the most beneficial and effective movement patterns that should be in any training program for building functional strength, packing on muscle, improving performance, and enhancing health and longevity.When it comes to single leg work, you’ll want to divide up your training into both split squats and lunges (stationary versus moving single leg variations) and incorporate varieties of weight placement, forms of resistance, planes of motion, ranges of motion, and tempos for maximal benefits.Without further ado, here’s my top 5 functional single leg exercises designed to improve function, pack on size, improve your performance, and durability.With the goal of muscular hypertrophy or self hatred, you can alter from your strongest stance to bias specific regions, muscles or actions to fit your needs as the loading is lower and the ranges are higher between 8-15 reps taken to form failure. This may look like front foot heel elevation for more of a quadriceps bias.",

        "blogDesc": "Forget this 90-degree nonsense that defies every established principle of biomechanics, movement anatomy, neurophysiology and motor skill development that’s been producing muscle, strength and resilience results for hundreds of years. But to avoid absolutist black and white “do THIS, not THAT” context, I believe that partial range of motion deserves a more nuanced discussion surrounding the range of motion spectrum, and how best to navigate it for gains across the board.When did strength training get so fucking complicated? Remember the days where you went into the gym, had a plan to learn some big lifts, perfect your form and add a little weight to that great form as you got stronger and needed more stimulus?The above outlines a pretty clear cut scenario for intelligently training according to the range of motion spectrum. But this entire “debate” if you want to call it that begs the question.",

        "blogDesc": "Claiming that Lat pulldowns don’t train the LATS is quite literally one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard. Next thing you know we’ll have IG influencers claiming triceps extensions don’t train the triceps, biceps curls don’t train the biceps, abdominal crunches don’t train the abs, and calf raises don’t train the calves. This sensationalizing of the ineffectiveness of simple staple NAME SAKE exercises needs to stop. Because the reality is, biomechanics and human anatomy has NOT changed in hundreds of thousands of years. And certainly NOT in our lifetime.In isolation, the lat’s textbook action is to adduct, extend and internally rotate the humerus (upper arm bone). If you dive into the anatomical actions of the lats one layer deeper you’ll learn that the lats also play a secondary roll in rotation and stabilization of the torso (upper and lower) along with the pelvis.",

        "blogDesc": "I know, this can be a tough conversation with yourself if you aren’t used to debating what you deserve. For that reason, I am going to give you 5 direct categories to help you better gauge how much you should be charging for your time.If you are training in a certain region anywhere in the world, it’s important to know what the going rate is within a 15 mile radius. Without this information, you are really operating in the dark.The current local rate is the baseline number you can operate off of when creating your hourly rate from the beginning. Plenty of big box gyms have already done hours and hours of market research to find out what the appropriate number is – so use that.Finding this number shouldn’t be difficult either. Contact or find out the pricing from 5 of the local gyms in the area by you.Keep in mind, the remaining four variables will adjust the price up or even down based on the other things you are bringing to the table. Honestly, rarely does the price go down from here unless you are teaching jumping jacks in the park.",

        "blogDesc": "“You just need to workout more!” Surely that’s the golden ticket to health, performance, longevity and transforming your physique, right? Absolutely not. If it were that easy, we wouldn’t be seeing the atrocious obesity and other preventable lifestyle disease problems that have stricken today’s society with no real notable hope in sight for remediation.But this simple idea that one must simply burn more calories by any means possible while likely forcing themselves into a highly restrictive and unhealthy diet simultaneously is unfortunately the idea that today’s mainstream fitness industry has been built on.This dubious combination of punishing workouts that are deemed “successful” only by the calorie output on a device and a tortuous eating existence rallied behind how many days are left until this “diet” is done is downright dangerous.And did I mention that it’s also one of the LEAST effective ways to lose weight, build your health or extend longevity with an improved lifestyle and skill set around training and nutrition that will serve you for a lifetime?",

        "blogDesc": "Menopause hip pain is among the many symptoms experienced during this time of life, next to hot flashes, hormonal changes, breast tenderness, and painful intercourse. It might not occur to you, but many female reproductive organs are located between the hip bones, in the pelvic cavity. This is why you might feel pain, soreness, or lack of mobility in this area during this time of transition for your body. While I am not yet in this season myself, Lindywell serves all generations. It’s frustrating to know that perimenopause and menopause are some of the least discussed (and least researched) experiences—and yet it’s a significant season of a woman’s life that brings about very real symptoms. Among the variety of bodily changes experienced at this time, hip pain is something we hear about a lot.Women who have completed menopause are susceptible to a condition known as gluteal tendinopathy. This causes the tendon tissues in your hips and glutes to deteriorate, resulting in musculoskeletal pain and inflammation. ",

After a few hundred thousand years of evolution, the human body is pretty smart, resilient, and will let you know when it’s pissed off or doesn’t like something.Now, I’m not insinuating that every expecting mother out there should go out and try to hit a deadlift PR on a weekly basis or snatch a mack truck over their head. But I’m certainly in the camp that feels we can offer a lot more than simply telling them to “go walk on the treadmill” or what mounts to playing patty cake for shits and giggles.",

Before you know it they’re living on a foam roller and thinking about a “neutral spine” while washing their hands.",

        "blogDesc": "I know this will surprise a lot of people when I say this, but I didn’t perform my first (real) deadlift until 2002 when I was 25 and still wet behind the ears with regards to my fitness career.It didn’t take long for me to become enamored with the deadlift. I loved that I was actually good at it, and I really loved how it made my body look and feel. It wasn’t long before I made it my mission to pull 500 lbs. It took me a little over a year to get there.A LOT of people deadlift with a mixed grip, and A LOT of people never tear their bicep tendon. Much the same that a lot of people drive their cars and never get into an accident.Offhandedly, straps do tend to slow people down which could be argued as a hinderance to performance. One mistake I see some trainees make with their setup is that they’ll bend over, grab the bar, and take way too long before they start their actual pull.",
