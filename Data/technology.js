        "blogDesc": "Every company wants to be a platform company — but not all can be.The push up pattern creates an ideal environment for improving your pressing strength and skill due to the closed chain biomechanics of the shoulders. The massive benefits to programming push ups should NEVER be overlooked in any type of health, fitness or performance program. TGenerative AI has unlocked new possibilities for customer and employee experiences — and as a result, customer and employee expectations have grown. Customers want solutions that enable flawless self-service and offer immediate and accurate advice, while employees want technology that lets them deliver better, more efficient experiences and support them in gaining stronger proficiency behind the scenes.It can be a trickier proposition than it seems, says Bonnie Chase, senior director, service product marketing at Coveo.",

        "blogDesc": "One of the hardest parts of the news business is striking a balance between covering stories that seem important in the moment and covering stories that you know will truly matter in the future. And it’s hard because the most consequential things happening right now are often boring or difficult to explain.Artificial intelligence is a good example of this sort of challenge. The ongoing revolution in AI is unfolding so quickly that it’s hard to keep up, even if you’re trying. Chat GPT-4, for instance, was released in March of this year and it stunned almost everyone who used it. If this latest large language model is a sign of what’s coming, it’s easy to imagine all the ways it might change the world — and then there are all the ways it might change the world that we can’t imagine.",

        "blogDesc": "As the debate heats up around the use of copyrighted works to train large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s Llama 2, Anthropic’s Claude 2, one obvious question arises: can these models even be altered or edited to remove their knowledge of such works, without totally retraining them or rearchitecting them? As the Microsoft researchers write: “While the model took over 184K GPU-hours to pretrain, we show that in about 1 GPU hour of finetuning, we effectively erase the model’s ability to generate or recall Harry Potter-related content.” This work provides an important step toward adaptable language models. The ability to refine AI over time according to shifting organizational needs is key to long-term, enterprise-safe deployments.",

        "blogDesc": "One of the big challenges of robotics is the amount of effort that has to be put into training machine learning models for each robot, task, and environment. Now, a new project by Google DeepMind and 33 other research institutions aims to address this challenge by creating a general-purpose AI system that can work with different types of physical robots and perform many tasks.To overcome this and make it far easier and faster to train and deploy robots, the new project, dubbed Open-X Embodiment, introduces two key components: a dataset containing data on multiple robot types and a family of models capable of transferring skills across a wide range of tasks. The researchers put the models to the test in robotics labs and on different types of robots, achieving superior results in comparison to the commonly used methods for training robots .",

IBM sees broader applicability for PyTorch and is working on a series of development initiatives that will see PyTorch used for inferencing.In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Raghu Ganti, principal research staff member at IBM detailed new research efforts that enable PyTorch to become a more viable enterprise option for inference. The market for inferencing technology software today has multiple players, with perhaps none larger than Nvidia’s Triton inferencing server. IBM’s goal with its PyTorch research is not necessarily to displace other technologies, but to provide a new open source alternative for inference that will run on multiple vendor technologies, as well as on both GPU and CPUs.Much of the community has been looking at PyTorch as a way to train models,” Ganti told VentureBeat.",

        "blogDesc": "Most organizations have no idea how many exposed, out-of-date endpoints they have or whether their remote and hybrid workers are safe. IT and security teams are often overwhelmed with work and conflicting urgent priorities. Unfortunately, it often takes an intrusion or breach for patching to become a priority. Cybercrime gangs and state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) threat actors who have launched the largest breaches in history — including the A.P. Møller-Maersk ransomware attack — often understand a target’s network better than admins. Whoever owns identities owns the business, and as devastating ransomware attacks show, threat actors are brazen about shutting an entire business down to meet demands.Complacency kills, especially when it comes to understanding where endpoints that remote and hybrid workers rely on are, and whether they’re current or not. More than half (60%) of enterprises know less than 75% of the endpoint devices on their network. Only 58% can identify every attacked or vulnerable asset on their network within 24 hours of an exploit.",
