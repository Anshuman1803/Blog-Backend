        "blogDesc": "Cricket is set for a return to the Olympics after a gap of 128 years with the organisers of the 2028 Los Angeles Games making a formal recommendation its inclusion in the T20 format.The last time cricket was part of the Olympic Games was in 1900 when England defeated France in a one-off match in Paris to win the gold medal.On Monday, LA 2028 organisers recommended including cricket alongside baseball/softball, flag football, lacrosse and squash in the Games in five years time. The final decision will be ratified at the IOC Session which will take place in India.“We are delighted that LA28 have recommended cricket for inclusion in the Olympics. Whilst this is not the final decision, it is a very significant landmark towards seeing cricket at the Olympics for the first time in more than a century,” ICC Chairman Greg Barclay said in reaction. The cricketing calendar is packed with ICC tournaments and bilateral series and Olympic participation means future calendars would have to be redrawn. However, it’s a move that is set to benefit cricket in more than one way besides enhancing its reputation as a global sport.",

        "blogDesc": "India’s performance at the Asian Games shows how far we have come and how Indians are becoming champions in sports other than cricket. It is time now for us, Indian sports fans, to do our bit.Given that we are at the start of another World Cup, we expect the excitement to peak in the coming weeks. Social media, office water coolers, public transport, parks, and any other gathering will have cricket discussions. Will India reach the semi-finals? What about the finals? Can we win?It’s all great. But while cricket shines brightest, there seems to be another amazing trend emerging as well. That is, the rise of Indian excitement in other sports, particularly those which Indians historically have cared little about. This has happened mainly because of recent Indian achievements in these sports. Suddenly, a medal win for India in the Olympics or Asian Games brings a surge of interest and attention. After all, were we ever interested in javelin throw before Neeraj Chopra won that Olympic Gold?",

        "blogDesc": "The Carolina Panthers were impatient at quarterback, and in the moment their trade to get a franchise quarterback seemed reasonable. Expensive, but reasonable. The Panthers fell to 0-5 on Sunday. The bad news about that, other than not having a win, is that they also don't have their 2024 first-round draft pick. That went to the Chicago Bears in the trade to get the first pick and Young. A lot of other assets went to the Bears in that trade, too. It's a reminder that the massive trade up to get a quarterback often isn't worth the price. Young hasn't looked great and that's not a big problem yet. He could live up to all of the kind words said about him before the draft. What the Panthers gave up is the problem. If you want a lesson in why impatience can be ruinous, just look at what the Panthers traded to get their quarterback right away rather than waiting a year. When the side-by-side comparison is done, it's going to look ugly for Carolina.",

        "blogDesc": "Former India opener Virender Sehwag believes that Team India should rest Ravichandran Ashwin for their upcoming 2023 World Cup clash against Afghanistan. After their win against Australia, India will now take on Afghanistan at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi on Wednesday, 11 October. The former India batter said that the Indian management should use Ashwin prudently and he should be rested in order to ensure his freshness for the rest of the tournament. Sehwag also suggested that Mohammed Shami could be considered as a replacement for the senior spinner in the playing XI for the upcoming match.“I think Ravichandran Ashwin will be rested. Mohammed Shami has been in wonderful form, and he even took a fifer against Australia. This is a different wicket, and the ground is also smaller. Also, there is the age factor with Ashwin. So, India will look to save him for the big matches,” Sehwag said.Ashwin was drafted into India’s squad for the World Cup after Axar Patel failed to recover from his injury. In India’s opening match of the World Cup against Australia in Chennai on Sunday, Ashwin was quite good as he conceded 34 runs from his full quota of 10 overs and picked up the wicket of Cameron Green.",

Being the highest-ranked team in the women’s event, anything less than gold would be seen as a failure. Also, a gold at Hangzhou 2022 doesn’t only guarantee glory but also a direct ticket to the Olympic Games Paris 2024.Ranking and stature, however, have never been a guarantee for the gold medal at the Asian Games. Despite being the favourites, India could only win a silver at the last edition in 2018 (Indonesia) as Japan took the gold. In 2014 in South Korea, India could only bag the bronze.India’s vice-captain and penalty corner specialist, Deep Grace Ekka, was part of the team in both the 2014 and 2018 Asiads. The 29-year-old from Odisha’s Sundargarh, the hotbed of hockey talent, is once again going to be one of the most crucial players for India at the Games.",
